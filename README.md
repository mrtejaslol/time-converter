# time-converter

This python script can do a helpful task. Converting the local time from local time zone to another Timezone (GMT). Eventually i had made this program to fing the PST time so that i could know what time a paticular bid would get over on eBay :). But when i finished typing the script, i came to know that this script converts local time to GMT and not PST.

# Usage
*For the linux/mac guys either run the time-2.7.py or time-3.5.py  depending upon the version of python installed in system.
*for the Windows guys either run the time-2.7.py or time-3.5.py  depending upon the version of python installed in system.

I would be very happy if someone improves this script
